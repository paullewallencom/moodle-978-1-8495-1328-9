Timeline Widget filter
======================

A Moodle filter to embed an MIT SIMILE Timeline Javascript interactive widget.
You and your class can use it to visualize temporal/ historical data.

Requirements: tested with Moodle 1.9.7 (all Moodle 1.9.x should work, Moodle 2.x may work- let me know).

Uses:  MIT SIMILE (v2.3.0); also, `parse_ini_string` function (see compat.php).

Installation
------------ 
1. Download and unzip the code files. Copy to the directory on the server,
   eg. `/var/www/moodle/filter/timelinewidget/`
2. Log in to Moodle as admin, visit Site Administration | Modules | Filters | Manage Filters. Scroll down and click on the icon for Timelinewidget to enable it.

Usage
-----
Type the following in Moodle's rich-editor (note, line-breaks, which can
be represented by &lt;br /> are required):

    [Timeline]
    ; A comment.
    title  = Important inventions timeline
    dataUrl= /moodle/file.php/2/simile-invent.xml
    ; The date on which to centre the timeline initially. This can
    ; be just a year, or a full date, eg. 20 January 1870.
    date   = 1870
    ; UPPER-CASE! minute,hour,day,week,month,year,decade,century,millenium.
    intervalUnit  = CENTURY
    ; How wide should the unit defined above be? In pixels.
    intervalPixels= 75
    [/Timeline]

Notes
-----
* The filter creates a very simple timeline, with only one band!
* In the near future, I plan to allow dynamic timeline generation from a Moodle Database activity.
